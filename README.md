# Language Learning Website - Interactive Features

## Image effects

### Hover effect
- When a user hovers over an image on the lessons page, the image **slightly** enlarges and its caption appears
- The purpose is to provide additional information about each level and create a more engaging user experience

### Click-to-enlarge
- When a user clicks on an image, it enlarges 
	- There is a close button on the top right corner
	- You can also click outside the image to close
	- You can also press the escape key to close
- The purpose is to allow users to see image details more clearly 

### Font type adjuster
- Available on all pages in the navigation area
- Options: sans-serif, serif, monospace
- When the user selects a different font option, the entire website's font changes 
- This allows users to customize their reading experience based on personal preference

### Search functionality
- This is available on all pages on the navigation area
- As of now, this is a placeholder feature. 内容がないから、placeholderです。

### Expected behavior across pages
- Home: displays welcome message in multiple languages
- Lessons: shows differnet fluency levels with interactive images
- Resrouces: provides links to learning resources (in this case, my favorite language learning software, Anki)

## Notes
- These features have been tested and should work on the main modern browsers (safari, chrome, edge)
